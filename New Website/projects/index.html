            <blockquote><strong><em> 1.   Sports Booking Facility, </em>IIT Kanpur</strong></blockquote><p>I worked with the Games and Sports Council and SPEC Office of IIT Kanpur to develop the Sports Booking Facility of IITK. It was developed in a time of crisis when covid had struck and sports facilities had to be reopened. This portal was built to limit the number of users and to keep a digital record of the same. The portal was built using Flutter and the Firebase was used as the database. I worked on the scalability of the portal to ensure that it could be easily used by all the campus residents, approximately 3000 at that time.</p><div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://gns-offline.web.app/#/" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Sports Booking Facility IITK Portal Link</a></div><blockquote><strong>2.   AI based labor room assistant</strong></blockquote><p>This project is under Dr. Vipul Arora (Prof, EE IITK). The project includes building an application that uses Automatic Speech Recognition to ease labor room procedures in low resource areas of Bihar. The aim is to ensure timely data documentation and build a delivery-complication detection system. The project has received funding of USD 30,000 under Google’s AI for Social Good program out of over 1000 global applications. The project is developed in Flutter and uses REST APIs to integrate with the backend in PHP. </p><blockquote><strong>3.   Management of debt structures of US states</strong></blockquote><p>This project includes building a database on the debt maturity structure from information in the Annual Comprehensive Financial Reports and analyzing changes in the debt maturity structure by extracting tables from old records and formatting them. It is designed as an algorithm with the help of Pandas for effective data analysis and manipulation. This is a contribution to the research work of Oliver Giesecke.</p><div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://github.com/Sahilsingh0808/US-Debt-Structures" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">US states Debt Github Repo</a></div><blockquote><strong>4.   Inter IIT ISRO problem statement</strong></blockquote><p>I worked in a team of 6 in Inter IIT Tech meet 10 to contribute to the ISRO problem statement.
